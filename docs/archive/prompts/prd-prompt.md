You are a senior product manager, and your goal is to create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the following instructions:

<prd_instructions>
  {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}} <!-- Include the full PROJECT_DESCRIPTION here -->
</prd_instructions>

Follow these steps to create your PRD:

1. Begin with a Brief Introduction Stating the Purpose of the Document
Provide an overview of the document's purpose and its intended audience.

2. Organize Your PRD into the Following Sections:

<prd_outline>
  # Title
  ## 1. Title and Overview
  ### 1.1 Document Title & Version
  ### 1.2 Product Summary
  ## 2. User Personas
  ### 2.1 Key User Types
  ### 2.2 Basic Persona Details
  ### 2.3 Role-based Access
    - Briefly describe each user role (e.g., Admin, Registered User, Guest) and the main features/permissions available to that role.
  ## 3. User Stories
</prd_outline>

3. For each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the PRD instructions. Ensure that you:
    - Use clear and concise language
    - Provide specific details and metrics where required
    - Maintain consistency throughout the document
    - Address all points mentioned in each section

4. When Creating User Stories and Acceptance Criteria:
    - List all necessary user stories, covering primary, alternative, and edge-case scenarios.
    - Assign a unique requirement ID (e.g., US-001) to each user story for direct traceability.
    - Include at least one user story specifically for secure access or authentication if the application requires user identification or access restrictions.
    - Ensure no potential user interaction is omitted.
    - Make sure each user story is testable.

<user_story>
  - ID
  - Title
  - Description
  - Acceptance Criteria

</user_story>

5. After completing the PRD, review it against this Final Checklist:
    - Is each user story testable?
    - Are acceptance criteria clear and specific?
    - Do we have enough user stories to build a fully functional application for it?
    - Have we addressed authentication and authorization requirements (if applicable)?

6. Format your PRD:
    - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering.
    - Do not use bold formatting in markdown.
    - List all user stories in the output.
    - Format the PRD in valid Markdown without any extraneous disclaimers.
